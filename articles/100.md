So this article's number is [100](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/100) now, but I think total articles in this blog is just around sixty to seventy.

Anyway, that's just some notes and murmurs. Now I really nervers about future.

My future,<br />
My family's future,<br />
My country's future,<br />
And future of someone I care.

Maybe I think too much?
