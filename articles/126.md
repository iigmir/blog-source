# My belief on AI generated content

I recently read [The downfall of content industry](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2023/11/weekly-issue-276.html) by Ruan.

I must say, I don't think it will devalue as the blogger said. Just see how AI works in Pixiv and what ChatGPT generated. AI helps people, but to total replace, there's still a long way to go. We still need content creators for now or in short terms.

Oh, will porn actress all replaced by AI, by the way?

The article reminds me another article, [The End of Front-End Development](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development), by Joshua Comeau.

The article's author doesn't see AI generated contents destroy developer's career because LLM is not magic, and still needs people to check inaccuracies. Also, demand for web developers may increase because [it is cheaper to hire a developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox).

Well... certainly it is devalue, but in a different insight.
