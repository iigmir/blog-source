# Pinia notes

[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) is a new state management library to adapt the Composition API feature in Vue 3.

The differences between Pinia and Vuex are:

Firstly, module mechanisms are different: In Pinia, every module is an independent store. Therefore, there are no `modules` and `namespaced` in Pinia. Instead, we use different stores when using different modules.

Then, Pinia rewrites their devtool implement. As a result, no `mutations` exists in Pinit. We only need to call `actions` to change the state. Talking to `state`, you can even change `state` without accessing `actions`. I don't recommend it, though.

Thirdly, you import store instances when you want to import store instead of using strings.

Finally, you can use [setup functions](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/#setup-stores) to arrange store in order to integrate with composition API.
