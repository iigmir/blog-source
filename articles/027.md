# Docker-compose in /usr/bin

I encountered a problem:

```shell
[***@localhost ***]$ sudo docker-compose
sudo: docker-compose: command not found
[***@localhost ***]$ sudo whereis docker-compose
docker-compose: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

I installed `docker-compose`, but there's no such command if executed as root. Pretty weird. I read what permission the file was and changed it, wish that works:

```shell
[***@localhost ***]$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 8856752 Nov  5 09:25 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
[****@localhost ****]$ sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
[sudo] password for **:
[****@localhost ****]$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/docker-compose         
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 8856752 Nov  5 09:25 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
[****@localhost ****]$ sudo docker-compose
sudo: docker-compose: command not found
[****@localhost ****]$
```

As you see, it's useless, root user still not found `docker-compose` command. Therefore, I asked my friend. He suggested that I should type `sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose` command to see absolute path works or not.

It works -- But I don't want to type absolute path always, what should I do? He said,

> Move to `/usr/bin`, and that's done.

Yes, moved to `/usr/bin` works. However, why it works? What's different between `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/bin`?

Here are my notes:

1. `/usr/local/bin` contain commands **what user have**.
2. Whereas, `/usr/bin` contain commands **what system have**.
3. But, if `/usr/local/bin` contain commands what user have, why `sudo` -- that is, root **user**-- cannot run `/usr/local/bin`? The answer is, `/usr/local/bin` don't have shell script for root user, as root user is so powerful that any action may result into danger.

That's all.
