# How to unpack an RPG Maker .exe file?

## Preface

Here's a question: What if you need to unpack an RPG Maker .exe file? If you try to understand how something in a game works, or you need to debug, you may want to unpack the `.exe` file.

## Disclaimer

The motive I wrote the article is to understand how programs work. Before doing the following steps, make sure you have the right to do it.

## TL;DR Steps

1. You need to have:
    * A `.exe` file you have rights to unpack.
    * An [RPG Maker MV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/363890/RPG_Maker_MV) editor.
2. Create an empty project in RPG Maker MV editor, then close it.
3. Delete files in the empty project except for the `Game.rpgproject` file.
4. Copy files under the `www` directory in the unpacked project, and paste them to the empty project directory.
5. Open the `Game.rpgproject` file in the editor again.
6. Explore the game.

## How do I know it?

At first, I tried to search "RPG Maker exe to project", but it doesn't have any useful information because of legal reasons, like [users of Reddit suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGMaker/comments/n532q7/is_it_possible_to_decompile_an_exe_file_into_the).

Then I found a site that describes [how did he unpack files](https://www.crowsong.xyz/127.html). He uses [Petschko's RPG-Maker-MV File-Decrypter](https://github.com/Petschko/Java-RPG-Maker-MV-Decrypter) and [EnigmaVBUnpacker](https://lifeinhex.com/update-of-unpackers) to do it.

But I made a mistake: [I downloaded an old version of EnigmaVBUnpacker](https://lifeinhex.com/updated-enigma-virtualbox-unpacker-again) (Tips: make sure the version you downloaded is correct). As a result, the program unpack failed. Therefore, I tried to find the other programs.

"Enigma Virtual Box, right?"

Later I found that UniExtract [can unpack EnigmaVB](https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2). [UniExtract](https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2) is a tool to unpack installer files. It is useful when I don't want to install anything on my computer. I haven't known that the program unpacks an EnigmaVB file, but [the manual](https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2/blob/master/docs/FORMATS.md) said so, so why not?

"Archive...Exact...OK...!" Then the program has unpacked. I can't believe it.

Here's another issue: How do make it works in RPG Maker MV?

I tried to find "rpg maker deployed exe to proj". Fortunately, [a user wanted to the same action](https://steamcommunity.com/app/363890/discussions/1/352792037324112104), and the other [replied some useful steps](https://steamcommunity.com/app/363890/discussions/1/352792037324112104/#c352792037324271745). I did it, and the whole game is now showing in front of my eyes.

So my journey ends here. But I found that the EnigmaVBUnpacker was updated when writing this article.
