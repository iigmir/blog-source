## Scripts
### How to use
Except shell script `./scripts/generate.sh` should use following command:
```
$ chmod 777 ./scripts/generate.sh
$ ./scripts/generate.sh
```
Other scripts are written in JavaScript files, should use following command:
```
$ node ./scripts/***.sh
```

About what those scripts for, refer each script files.
